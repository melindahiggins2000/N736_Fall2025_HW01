* make a copy to WORK;

data helpmkh;
  set library.helpmkh;
  run;

* check data read in ok;
proc contents data=helpmkh; run;

* run proc univariate to get descriptive stats
  and check the normality assumptions of the
  following numeric/continuous vars
  - add other variables for rest of homework;

proc univariate data=helpmkh plots;
  var age mcs cesd d1 e2b;
  run;

* you can also use proc means
  here is an example for descriptive stats
  for age and mcs;

proc means data=helpmkh n min max mean std;
  var age mcs;
  run;

* and for
  non-parametric stats next
  - add other non-normal vars for homework;

proc means data=helpmkh n min max median q1 q3;
  var d1 e2b;
  run;

* get frequencies for categorical variables
  - add other variables for homework;

proc freq data=helpmkh;
  tables racegrp;
  run;
